The config file is the file that is used to configure each module individually. Its **default path** is `~/.absence/config.toml` and has the following **default content**:

```toml title="~/.absence/config.toml"
[domain_takeover]
enabled = false

[dork]
enabled = false

[passive_dns]
enabled = false
```

Every module can be `enabled` by setting its value to `true`. Some modules have settings that can be set specifically for that module only; see the page of the modules to know what can be set.

Any non-needed module can just be removed from the config file as well.
