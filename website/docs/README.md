    Project Absence is a domain and server OSINT tool for system administrators and security engineers. It currently supports subdomain discovery and detection of potential domain takeover opportunities on common hosting platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    To maintain an OSINT-only approach, the tool contacts each discovered domain or server only once, to capture a screenshot and extract information based on the returned content - valuable data that can help and lead to further discoveries.
  </p>
  <p>
    More features are in development.
